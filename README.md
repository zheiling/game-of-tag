# Game of tag
A simplified version of Game of Tag
It uses "C with Classes" paradigm.

~~In order to open / save session it uses pseudo-JSON format - the fields can only appear in a certain order.~~
## TODO
- [x] Basic JSON interpreter, count commas in arrays and detect type of it items
- [x] make JSON_field_clear
- [x] Gameplay: Implement the ability to click on other than the nearest block (move several objects at once)
- [x] Save/Load: Check for the feasibility of the steps on load the save
- [x] Save/Load: Make synchronization and step execution virtual
- [x] Breaks down when entering a new seed
